A project designed to make picking something to eat easier. Contains mostly vegan recipes from Allrecipes.com. 

main.py - Handles user choices and main application loop.

recipes.csv - The generated (and cleaned) CSV file of scraped recipes. These results have been cleaned through a combination of manual and automatic parsing. 

scraper.py - The logic of the web scraper. Both the Request and data parsing happen here. 

view.py - Heavily a WIP. This will act as a GUI for the program which currently runs as a CLI.
